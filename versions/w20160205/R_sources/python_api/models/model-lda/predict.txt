.. function:: predict(self, document)

    |ALPHA|
    Predict conditional probabilities of topics given document.


    :Parameters:

        **document** : list

        ..

            Document whose topics are to be predicted. 




    :Returns:

            The data returned is composed of multiple keys\:

            |   **list of doubles** | *topics_given_doc*
            |       List of conditional probabilities of topics given document.
            |   **int** : *new_words_count*
            |       Count of new words in test document not present in training set.
            |   **double** | *new_words_percentage*
            |       Percentage of new words in test document.
    Predicts conditional probabilities of topics given document using trained Latent Dirichlet Allocation model.
    The input document is represented as a list of strings
