.. function:: publish(self)

    Creates a tar file that will be used as input to the scoring engine

            Returns the HDFS path to the trained model's tar file
    The publish method exports the RandomForestClassifierModel and its implementation into a tar file. 
      The tar file is then published on HDFS and this method returns the path to the tar file. 
      The tar file serves as input to the scoring engine. This model can then be used to predict the cluster assignment of an observation.
