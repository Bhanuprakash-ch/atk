.. function:: test(self, frame, label_column, observation_columns=None)

    |ALPHA|
    Predict test frame labels and return metrics.


    :Parameters:

        **frame** : Frame

        ..

            A frame whose labels are to be predicted.
            By default, predict is run on the same columns over which the model is
            trained.



        **label_column** : unicode

        ..

            Column containing the actual
            label for each observation.



        **observation_columns** : list (default=None)

        ..

            Column(s) containing the
            observations whose labels are to be predicted.
            By default, we predict the labels over columns the NaiveBayesModel
            was trained on.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            A dictionary with binary classification metrics.
            The data returned is composed of the following keys\:

                          |  'accuracy' : double
                          |  The proportion of predictions that are correctly identified
                          |  'confusion_matrix' : dictionary
                          |  A table used to describe the performance of a classification model
                          |  'f_measure' : double
                          |  The harmonic mean of precision and recall
                          |  'precision' : double
                          |  The proportion of predicted positive instances that are correctly identified
                          |  'recall' : double
                          |  The proportion of positive instances that are correctly identified.
    Predict the labels for a test frame and run classification metrics on predicted
    and target labels.
