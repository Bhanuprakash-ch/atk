    Support Vector Machine [1]_ is a supervised algorithm used to
    perform binary classification.
    A support vector machine constructs a high dimensional hyperplane which is
    said to achieve a good separation when a hyperplane has the largest distance to
    the nearest training-data point of any class. This model runs the
    LIBSVM [2]_ [3]_ implementation of SVM.
    The LIBSVM model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, used to
    predict the labels of observations in a frame and used to test the predicted
    labels against the true labels.
    During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against
    the true labels using built-in binary Classification Metrics.
