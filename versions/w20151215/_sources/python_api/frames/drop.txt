.. function:: drop(items=None)

    drop() serves as an alias to drop_frames, drop_graphs, and drop_models.


    :Parameters:

        **items** : List of strings (frame, graph, or model name) or proxy objects (the frame, graph, or model object itself). (default=None)

        ..

            Deletes the specified frames, graphs, and models from the server.




    :Returns:

        : int

        ..

            Number of items deleted.
    It accepts multiple parameters, which can contain strings (the name of the frame, graph, or model),
    proxy objects (the frame, graph, or model object itself), or a list of strings and/or proxy objects.
    If the item provided is a string and no frame, graph, or model is found with the specified name,
    no action is taken.

    If the item type is not recognized (not a string, frame, graph, or model) an ArgumentError is raised.

    Examples
    --------

    Given a frame, model, and graph like:

        .. code::

            >>> my_frame = ta.Frame()

            >>> my_model = ta.KMeansModel()
            [===Job Progress===]

            >>> my_graph = ta.Graph()
            -etc-

    The drop() command can be used to delete the frame, model, and graph from the server.  It returns the number
    of items that have been deleted.

        .. code::

            >>> ta.drop(my_frame, my_model, my_graph)
            3

    Alternatively, we can pass the object's string name to drop() like:

    .. code::

            >>> my_frame = ta.Frame(name='example_frame')

            >>> ta.drop('example_frame')
            1
