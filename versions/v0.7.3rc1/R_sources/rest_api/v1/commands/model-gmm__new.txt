**Description**

A Gaussian Mixture Model [1]_ represents a distribution where the observations are drawn from one of the k
Gaussian sub-distributions, each with its own probability. Each observation can belong to only one cluster,
the cluster representing the distribution with highest probability for that observation.

The gmm model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, and used to
predict cluster assignments for a frame.
This model runs the MLLib implementation of gmm [2]_ with enhanced
feature of computing the number of elements in each cluster during training.
During predict, it computes the cluster assignment of the observations given in the frame.
