            Status of the frame
    One of three statuses: Active, Dropped, Finalized
       Active:    Entity is available for use
       Dropped:   Entity has been dropped by user or by garbage collection which found it stale
       Finalized: Entity's data has been deleted

    Examples
    --------
    Given that we have an existing data frame *my_data*, create a Frame,
    then show the frame schema:

    .. code::

        >>> BF = ta.get_frame('my_data')
        >>> print BF.status

    The result is:

    .. code::

        u'Active'
