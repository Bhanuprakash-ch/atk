            A new instance of KMeansModel
    k-means [1]_ is an unsupervised algorithm used to partition
    the data into 'k' clusters.
    Each observation can belong to only one cluster, the cluster with the nearest
    mean.
    The k-means model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, and used to
    predict cluster assignments for a frame.
    This model runs the MLLib implementation of k-means [2]_ with enhanced
    features, computing the number of elements in each cluster during training.
    During predict, it computes the distance of each observation from its cluster
    center and also from every other cluster center.
