.. function:: predict(self, document)

    |BETA|
    Predict conditional probabilities of topics given document.


    :Parameters:

        **document** : list

        ..

            Document whose topics are to be predicted. 




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            dict
                Dictionary containing predicted topics.
                The data returned is composed of multiple components:
            topics_given_doc : list of doubles
                List of conditional probabilities of topics given document.
            new_words_count : int
                Count of new words in test document not present in training set.
            new_words_percentage: double
                Percentage of new words in test document.
    Predicts conditional probabilities of topics given document using trained Latent Dirichlet Allocation model.
    The input document is represented as a list of strings
