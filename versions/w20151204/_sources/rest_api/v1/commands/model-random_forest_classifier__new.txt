**Description**

Random Forest [1]_ is a supervised ensemble learning algorithm
which can be used to perform binary and multi-class classification.
The Random Forest Classifier model is initialized, trained on columns of a
frame, used to predict the labels of observations in a frame, and tests the
predicted labels against the true labels.
This model runs the MLLib implementation of Random Forest [2]_.
During training, the decision trees are trained in parallel.
During prediction, each tree's prediction is counted as vote for one class.
The label is predicted to be the class which receives the most votes.
During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against the true labels
using built-in binary and multi-class Classification Metrics.
