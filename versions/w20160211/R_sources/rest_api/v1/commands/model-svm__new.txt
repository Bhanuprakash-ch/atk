**Description**

Support Vector Machine [1]_ is a supervised algorithm used to
perform binary classification.
A Support Vector Machine constructs a high dimensional hyperplane which is
said to achieve a good separation when a hyperplane has the largest distance
to the nearest training-data point of any class.
This model runs the MLLib implementation of SVM [2]_ with SGD [3]_ optimizer.
The SVMWithSGD model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, used to
predict the labels of observations in a frame, and tests the predicted labels
against the true labels.
During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against
the true labels using built-in binary Classification Metrics.
