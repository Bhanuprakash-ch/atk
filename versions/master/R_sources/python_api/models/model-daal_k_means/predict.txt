.. function:: predict(self, frame, observation_columns=None, label_column=None)

    |ALPHA|
    Predict the cluster assignments for the data points.


    :Parameters:

        **frame** : Frame

        ..

            A frame whose labels are to be predicted.
            By default, predict is run on the same columns over which the model is
            trained.



        **observation_columns** : list (default=None)

        ..

            Column(s) containing the observations
            whose clusters are to be predicted.
            Default is to predict the clusters over columns the KMeans model was trained on.



        **label_column** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            Name of output column with
            index of cluster each observation belongs to.




    :Returns:

        : Frame

        ..

            Frame
                A new frame consisting of the existing columns of the frame and the following new columns:
                'k' columns : Each of the 'k' columns containing squared distance of that observation to the 'k'th cluster center
                predicted_cluster column: The cluster assignment for the observation
    Predicts the clusters for each data point and distance to every cluster center of the frame using the trained model
