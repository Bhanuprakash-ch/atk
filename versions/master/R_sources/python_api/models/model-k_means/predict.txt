.. function:: predict(self, frame, observation_columns=None)

    |BETA|
    Predict the cluster assignments for the data points.


    :Parameters:

        **frame** : Frame

        ..

            A frame whose labels are to be predicted.
            By default, predict is run on the same columns over which the model is
            trained.



        **observation_columns** : list (default=None)

        ..

            Column(s) containing the observations
            whose clusters are to be predicted.
            Default is to predict the clusters over columns the KMeans model was trained on.
            The columns are scaled using the same values used when training the
            model.




    :Returns:

        : Frame

        ..

            Frame
                A new frame consisting of the existing columns of the frame and the following new columns:
                'k' columns : Each of the 'k' columns containing squared distance of that observation to the 'k'th cluster center
                predicted_cluster column: The cluster assignment for the observation
    Predicts the clusters for each data point and distance to every cluster center of the frame using the trained model
