:name:

    model:daal_k_means/predict

:arguments:


    **model** : Model

    ..

        <Missing Description>



    **frame** : Frame

    ..

        A frame whose labels are to be predicted.
        By default, predict is run on the same columns over which the model is
        trained.



    **observation_columns** : list (default=None)

    ..

        Column(s) containing the observations
        whose clusters are to be predicted.
        Default is to predict the clusters over columns the KMeans model was trained on.



    **label_column** : unicode (default=None)

    ..

        Name of output column with
        index of cluster each observation belongs to.

            A new frame consisting of the existing columns of the frame and the following new columns:
            'k' columns : Each of the 'k' columns containing squared distance of that observation to the 'k'th cluster center
            predicted_cluster column: The cluster assignment for the observation
