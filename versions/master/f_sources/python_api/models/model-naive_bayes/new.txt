            A new instance of NaiveBayesModel
    Naive Bayes [1]_ is a probabilistic classifier with strong
    independence assumptions between features.
    It computes the conditional probability distribution of each feature given label,
    and then applies Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability
    distribution of a label given an observation, and use it for prediction.
    The Naive Bayes model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, tested against true labels of a frame and used
    to predict the value of the dependent variable given the independent
    observations of a frame.
    This model runs the MLLib implementation of Naive Bayes [2]_.
