    Creates a tar file that will be used as input to the scoring engine

            Returns the HDFS path to the trained model's tar file
    The publish method exports the PrincipalComponentsModel and its implementation into a tar file. The tar file is then published
    on HDFS and this method returns the path to the tar file. The tar file serves as input to the scoring engine. This model can
    then be used to compute the principal components and t-squared index(if requested) of an observation.
