.. function:: tally(self, sample_col, count_val)

    |BETA|
    Count number of times a value is seen.


    :Parameters:

        **sample_col** : unicode

        ..

            The name of the column from which to compute the cumulative count.



        **count_val** : unicode

        ..

            The column value to be used for the counts.




    :Returns:

        : _Unit

        ..


    A cumulative count is computed by sequentially stepping through the rows,
    observing the column values and keeping track of the number of times the specified
    *count_value* has been seen.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider Frame *my_frame*, which accesses a frame that contains a single
    column named *obs*:

        >>> my_frame.inspect()
        [#]  obs
        ========
        [0]    0
        [1]    1
        [2]    2
        [3]    0
        [4]    1
        [5]    2

    The cumulative percent count for column *obs* is obtained by:

        >>> my_frame.tally("obs", "1")
        [===Job Progress===]

    The Frame *my_frame* accesses the original frame that now contains two
    columns, *obs* that contains the original column values, and
    *obsCumulativePercentCount* that contains the cumulative percent count:

        >>> my_frame.inspect()
        [#]  obs  obs_tally
        ===================
        [0]    0        0.0
        [1]    1        1.0
        [2]    2        1.0
        [3]    0        1.0
        [4]    1        2.0
        [5]    2        2.0
