.. function:: tally_percent(self, sample_col, count_val)

    |BETA|
    Compute a cumulative percent count.


    :Parameters:

        **sample_col** : unicode

        ..

            The name of the column from which to compute
            the cumulative sum.



        **count_val** : unicode

        ..

            The column value to be used for the counts.




    :Returns:

        : _Unit

        ..


    A cumulative percent count is computed by sequentially stepping through
    the rows, observing the column values and keeping track of the percentage of the
    total number of times the specified *count_value* has been seen up to
    the current value.

    Examples
    --------
    Consider Frame *my_frame*, which accesses a frame that contains a single
    column named *obs*:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.inspect()

          obs:int32
        /-----------/
             0
             1
             2
             0
             1
             2

    The cumulative percent count for column *obs* is obtained by:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.tally_percent('obs', 1)

    The Frame *my_frame* accesses the original frame that now contains two
    columns, *obs* that contains the original column values, and
    *obsCumulativePercentCount* that contains the cumulative percent count:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.inspect()

          obs:int32    obs_tally_percent:float64
        /----------------------------------------/
             0                         0.0
             1                         0.5
             2                         0.5
             0                         0.5
             1                         1.0
             2                         1.0
