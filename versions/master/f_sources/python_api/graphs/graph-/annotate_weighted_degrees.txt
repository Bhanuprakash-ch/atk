.. function:: annotate_weighted_degrees(self, output_property_name, degree_option=None, input_edge_labels=None, edge_weight_property=None, edge_weight_default=None)

    Calculates the weighted degree of each vertex with respect to an (optional) set of labels.


    :Parameters:

        ..

            property name of where to store output



        **degree_option** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            choose from 'out', 'in', 'undirected'



        **input_edge_labels** : list (default=None)

        ..

            labels of edge types that should be included



        **edge_weight_property** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            property name of edge weight, if not provided all edges are weighted equally



        **edge_weight_default** : float64 (default=None)

        ..

            default edge weight




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..


    Pulls graph from underlying store, calculates weighted degrees and writes them into the property
    specified, and then writes the output graph to the underlying store.

    **Degree Calculation**

    A fundamental quantity in graph analyses is the degree of a vertex:
    The degree of a vertex is the number of edges adjacent to it.

    For a directed edge relation, a vertex has both an out-degree (the number of
    edges leaving the vertex) and an in-degree (the number of edges entering the
    vertex).

    The toolkit provides a routine :ref:`annotate_degrees
    <python_api/graphs/graph-/annotate_weighted_degrees>`
    for calculating the degrees of vertices.
    This calculation could be performed with a Gremlin query on smaller datasets
    because Gremlin queries cannot be executed on a distributed scale.
    The |PACKAGE| routine ``annotate_degrees`` can be executed at distributed scale.

    In the presence of edge weights, vertices can have weighted degrees: The
    weighted degree of a vertex is the sum of weights of edges adjacent to it.
    Analogously, the weighted in-degree of a vertex is the sum of the weights of
    the edges entering it, and the weighted out-degree is the sum
    of the weights of the edges leaving the vertex.

    The toolkit provides this routine for the distributed calculation of weighted
    vertex degrees.
