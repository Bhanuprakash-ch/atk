.. function:: predict(self, timeseries_values, future_periods)

    |ALPHA|
    Forecasts future periods using ARIMA.


    :Parameters:

        **timeseries_values** : list

        ..

            Time series values to use as the gold standard.



        **future_periods** : int32

        ..

            Number of periods in the future to forecast (beyond the length the time series)




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            A series of 1-step ahead forecasts for historicals and then future periods
            of forecasts.
    Provided fitted values of the time series as 1-step ahead forecasts, based
    on current model parameters, then provide future periods of forecast.  We assume
    AR terms prior to the start of the series are equal to the model's intercept term
    (or 0.0, if fit without an intercept term).  Meanwhile, MA terms prior to the start
    are assumed to be 0.0.  If there is differencing, the first d terms come from the
    original series.
