.. function:: entropy(self, data_column, weights_column=None)

    Calculate the Shannon entropy of a column.


    :Parameters:

        **data_column** : unicode

        ..

            The column whose entropy is to be calculated.



        **weights_column** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            The column that provides weights (frequencies) for the entropy calculation.
            Must contain numerical data.
            Default is using uniform weights of 1 for all items.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            Entropy.
    The data column is weighted via the weights column.
    All data elements of weight <= 0 are excluded from the calculation, as are
    all data elements whose weight is NaN or infinite.
    If there are no data elements with a finite weight greater than 0,
    the entropy is zero.

    Examples
    --------
    Given a frame of coin flips, half heads and half tails, the entropy is simply ln(2):
    .. code::

        >>> print frame.inspect()

                  data:unicode  
                /----------------/
                  H             
                  T             
                  H             
                  T             
                  H             
                  T             
                  H             
                  T             
                  H             
                  T             

        >>> print "Computed entropy:", frame.entropy("data")

                Computed entropy: 0.69314718056

    If we have more choices and weights, the computation is not as simple.
    An on-line search for "Shannon Entropy" will provide more detail.

    .. code::

       >>> print frame.inspect()
                  data:int32   weight:int32  
                -----------------------------
                           0              1  
                           1              2  
                           2              4  
                           4              8  

       >>> print "Computed entropy:", frame.entropy("data", "weight")

                Computed entropy: 1.13691659183
