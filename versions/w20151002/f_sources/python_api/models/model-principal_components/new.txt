            A new instance of PrincipalComponentsModel
    Principal component analysis [1]_ is a statistical algorithm
    that converts possibly correlated features to linearly uncorrelated variables
    called principal components.
    The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of
    original variables.
    This implementation of computing Principal Components is done by Singular
    Value Decomposition [2]_ of the data, providing the user with an option to
    mean center the data.
    The Principal Components model is initialized; trained on
    specifying the observation columns of the frame and the number of components;
    used to predict principal components.
    The MLLib Singular Value Decomposition [3]_ implementation has been used for
    this, with additional features to 1) mean center the data during train and
    predict and 2) compute the t-squared index during prediction.
