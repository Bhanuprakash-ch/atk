.. function:: drop_duplicates(self, unique_columns=None)

    Remove duplicate vertex rows.


    :Parameters:

        **unique_columns** : None (default=None)

    :Returns:

        : _Unit

    Remove duplicate vertex rows, keeping only one vertex row per uniqueness
    criteria match.
    Edges that were connected to removed vertices are also automatically dropped.

    Examples
    --------
    Remove any rows that have the same data in column *b* as a previously
    checked row:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.drop_duplicates("b")

    The result is a frame with unique values in column *b*.

    Remove any rows that have the same data in columns *a* and *b* as a
    previously checked row:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.drop_duplicates([ "a", "b"] )

    The result is a frame with unique values for the combination of columns
    *a* and *b*.

    Remove any rows that have the whole row identical:

    .. code::

        >>> my_frame.drop_duplicates()

    The result is a frame where something is different in every row from every
    other row.
    Each row is unique.
