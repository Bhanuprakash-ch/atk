**Description**

Principal component analysis [1]_ is a statistical algorithm
that converts possibly correlated features to linearly uncorrelated variables
called principal components.
The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of
original variables.
This implementation of computing Principal Components is done by Singular
Value Decomposition [2]_ of the data, providing the user with an option to
mean center the data.
The Principal Components model is initialized; trained on
specifying the observation columns of the frame and the number of components;
used to predict principal components.
The MLLib Singular Value Decomposition [3]_ implementation has been used for
this, with additional features to 1) mean center the data during train and
predict and 2) compute the t-squared index during prediction.
