.. function:: drop(items=None)

    drop() serves as an alias to drop_frames, drop_graphs, and drop_models.


    :Parameters:

        **items** : List of strings (frame, graph, or model name) or proxy objects (the frame, graph, or model object itself). (default=None)

        ..

            Deletes the specified frames, graphs, and models from the server.




    :Returns:

        : int

        ..

            Number of items deleted.
    It accepts a list of items, which can contain strings (the name of the frame, graph, or model)
    or proxy objects (the frame, graph, or model object itself).  If the item provided is a string
    and no frame, graph, or model is found with the specified name, no action is taken.

    If the item type is not recognized (not a string, frame, graph, or model) an ArgumentError is raised.
