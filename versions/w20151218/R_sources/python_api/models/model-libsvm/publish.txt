            Returns the HDFS path to the trained model's tar file
    The publish method exports the LibsvmModel and its implementation into a tar file. The tar file is then published on 
    HDFS and this method returns the path to the tar file. The tar file serves as input to the scoring engine.
    This model can then be used to predict the class of an observation.
