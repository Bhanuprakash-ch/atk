    **Classification using Logistic Regression**

    Logistic Regression[1]_ is a widely used supervised binary and multi-class classification algorithm. The user may initialize a LogisticRegressionModel,
    train the model on columns of a frame, use the model to predict the labels of observations in a frame and test the predicted labels against the true labels. This model
    runs the MLLib implementation of LogisticRegression[2]_ with enhanced features - trained model Summary Statistics, Covariance and Hessian Matrices, and
    ability to specify the frequency of the train and test observations. Testing performance can be viewed via in-built binary and multiclass Classification Metrics. It also allows
    the user to select the optimizer to be used - L-BFGS[3]_ or SGD[4]_.
