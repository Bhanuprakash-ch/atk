**Description**

**Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis**

Principal component analysis[1]_ is a statistical algorithm that converts possibly correlated features to linearly uncorrelated
variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original
variables. This implementation of computing Principal Components is done by Singular Value Decomposition[2]_ of the data,
providing the user with an option to mean center the data. The user may initialize a PrincipalComponentsModel, train the model
specifying the observation columns of the frame, the number of components, and predict principal components using the trained model.
The MLLib Singular Value Decomposition[3]_ implementation has been used for this, with additional features to mean center the data during train and
predict and compute the t-squared index during prediction.
