.. function:: bin_column_equal_width(self, column_name, num_bins=None, bin_column_name=None)

    Classify column into same-width groups.


    :Parameters:

        **column_name** : unicode

        ..

            The column whose values are to be binned.



        **num_bins** : int32 (default=None)

        ..

            The maximum number of bins.
            Default is the Square-root choice
            :math:`\lfloor \sqrt{m} \rfloor`, where :math:`m` is the number of rows.



        **bin_column_name** : unicode (default=None)

        ..

            The name for the new column holding the grouping labels.
            Default is ``<column_name>_binned``.




    :Returns:

        : dict

        ..

            A list of the edges of each bin.
    Group rows of data based on the value in a single column and add a label
    to identify grouping.

    Equal width binning places column values into groups such that the values
    in each group fall within the same interval and the interval width for each
    group is equal.

    **Notes**

    #)  Unicode in column names is not supported and will likely cause the
        drop_frames() method (and others) to fail!
    #)  The num_bins parameter is considered to be the maximum permissible number
        of bins because the data may dictate fewer bins.
        For example, if the column to be binned has 10
        elements with only 2 distinct values and the *num_bins* parameter is
        greater than 2, then the number of actual number of bins will only be 2.
        This is due to a restriction that elements with an identical value must
        belong to the same bin.

    Examples
    --------
    Given a frame with column *a* accessed by a Frame object *my_frame*:

    >>> my_frame.inspect( n=11 )
    [##]  a 
    ========
    [0]    1
    [1]    1
    [2]    2
    [3]    3
    [4]    5
    [5]    8
    [6]   13
    [7]   21
    [8]   34
    [9]   55
    [10]  89

    Modify the frame, adding a column showing what bin the data is in.
    The data should be separated into a maximum of five bins and the bin cutoffs
    should be evenly spaced.
    Note that there may be bins with no members:

    >>> cutoffs = my_frame.bin_column_equal_width('a', 5, 'aEWBinned')
    [===Job Progress===]
    >>> my_frame.inspect( n=11 )
    [##]  a   aEWBinned
    ===================
    [0]    1          0
    [1]    1          0
    [2]    2          0
    [3]    3          0
    [4]    5          0
    [5]    8          0
    [6]   13          0
    [7]   21          1
    [8]   34          1
    [9]   55          3
    [10]  89          4

    The method returns a list of 6 cutoff values that define the edges of each bin.
    Note that difference between the cutoff values is constant:

    >>> print cutoffs
    [1.0, 18.6, 36.2, 53.8, 71.4, 89.0]
