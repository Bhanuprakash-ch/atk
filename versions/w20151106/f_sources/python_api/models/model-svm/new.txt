            A new instance of SvmModel
    Support Vector Machine [1]_ is a supervised algorithm used to
    perform binary classification.
    A Support Vector Machine constructs a high dimensional hyperplane which is
    said to achieve a good separation when a hyperplane has the largest distance
    to the nearest training-data point of any class.
    This model runs the MLLib implementation of SVM [2]_ with SGD [3]_ optimizer.
    The SVMWithSGD model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, used to
    predict the labels of observations in a frame, and tests the predicted labels
    against the true labels.
    During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against
    the true labels using built-in binary Classification Metrics.
