            A new instance of LogisticRegressionModel
    Logistic Regression [1]_ is a widely used supervised binary and multi-class classification algorithm.
    The Logistic Regression model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, predicts the labels
    of observations, and tests the predicted labels against the true labels.
    This model runs the MLLib implementation of Logistic Regression [2]_, with enhanced features |EM|
    trained model summary statistics; Covariance and Hessian matrices; ability to specify the frequency
    of the train and test observations.
    Testing performance can be viewed via built-in binary and multi-class Classification Metrics.
    It also allows the user to select the optimizer to be used - L-BFGS [3]_ or SGD [4]_.
