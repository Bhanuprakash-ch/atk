  The algorithm follows the next steps:
    At initial condition, nodes carry a label that denotes the community they
belong. Belonging to a community changes, based on the labels that the
neighboring nodes possess. This change is subject to the maximum number of
labels within one degree of the nodes. Every node is initialized with a unique
label then the labels diffuse through the network. Consequently, densely
connected groups reach a common label quickly. When many such dense
(consensus) groups are created throughout the network, they continue to expand
outwards until it is possible to do so.[1]
    The process in 5 steps:[1]
     1. Initialize the labels at all nodes in the network. For a given node x,
Cx (0) = x.
     2. Set t = 1.
     3. Arrange the nodes in the network in a random order and set it to X.
     4. For each x in X chosen in that specific order, let Cx(t) = f(Cxi1(t),
...,Cxim(t),Cxi(m+1) (t − 1), ...,Cxik (t − 1)). f here returns the label
occurring with the highest frequency among neighbours.
     5. If every node has a label that the maximum number of their neighbours
have, then stop the algorithm. Else, set t = t + 1 and go to (3).
